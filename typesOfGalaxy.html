        We currently know three main types of galaxies, with a few subtypes. Here’s a brief overview:
<h4>Spiral Galaxies</h4>
<strong>Shape</strong>: Flat, rotating disk with spiral arms.
<strong>Stars</strong>: Mix of young and old stars.
<strong>Example</strong>: Milky Way, Andromeda Galaxy.
<strong>Fun fact</strong>: Spiral arms are sites of active star formation.
<h4>Elliptical Galaxies</h4>
<strong>Shape</strong>: Rounded or oval, smooth appearance.
<strong>Stars</strong>: Mostly older stars, very little gas or dust.
<strong>Example</strong>: M87 in Virgo Cluster.
<strong>Fun fact</strong>: Often found in galaxy clusters as “giant ellipticals.”
<h4>Irregular Galaxies</h4>
<strong>Shape</strong>: No definite structure, chaotic appearance.
<strong>Fun fact</strong>: Often result from galaxy collisions or gravitational interactions.
<strong>Stars</strong>: Mix of young stars, lots of gas and dust.
<strong>Example</strong>: Large Magellanic Cloud.
