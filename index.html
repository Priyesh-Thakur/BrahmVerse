      The universe is an endless expanse of space and time, filled with billions
      of galaxies, stars, planets, and cosmic wonders. It began around 13.8
      billion years ago with the Big Bang and continues to expand. From black
      holes to nebulae, the universe holds mysteries that inspire exploration
      and discovery.
