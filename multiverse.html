    <p><pre>As of now, we only have direct knowledge of one universe—our own observable universe. Everything we can measure, observe, and study scientifically is within this universe.

The concept of multiple universes or a multiverse exists in theoretical physics, but these are mostly speculative ideas based on mathematics and theory, not observation. Some key points:

Observable Universe – This is the part of the universe we can see, limited by the speed of light and the age of the universe (~13.8 billion years).

Beyond Observable – There may be more universe beyond what we can see, but we have no data about it yet.

Multiverse Theories – Hypothetical ideas suggest there could be many universes, e.g.,:

Bubble universes (from cosmic inflation)

Many-worlds interpretation (from quantum mechanics)

Parallel dimensions in string theory

But so far, only one universe has empirical evidence. All others are purely theoretical.</pre></p>
