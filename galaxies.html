 A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. They come in three main types: spiral (like our Milky Way), elliptical (round or oval), and irregular (no clear shape). Galaxies can contain millions to trillions of stars and are often grouped into clusters and superclusters. Our Milky Way alone has 100â€“400 billion stars and is part of the Local Group of galaxies.</p></br>
