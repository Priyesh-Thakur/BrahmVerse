    <h2>The Universess</h2>
    <p><pre>The universe is a vast expanse of space containing everythingâ€”galaxies, stars, planets, black holes, and dark matter. It has been expanding since the Big Bang, about 13.8 billion years ago, and is still growing today.

Fun Facts:

Most of the Universe is Invisible: Around 95% of the universe is made of dark matter and dark energy, which we can't see or touch! Only 5% is ordinary matter like stars, planets, and people.

Rogue Planets Exist: There are planets wandering the galaxy without orbiting any star, floating alone in the darkness. Some are bigger than Jupiter!
